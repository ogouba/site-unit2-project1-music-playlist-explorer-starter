### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Add your response here: yes the topics that we were taught helped me to create this project

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Add your response here: i would have iplemented my search function. I would also have found a way to get more data and files that would help me to have more playlists for people to be able to go thru. i would have authenticated user login system and i would have finished designing my css file to make the website more appealing .

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Add your response here: the implemetation of the functions went well. I had no previous knowledge of wither javascript, HTML or CSS as at Tueday morning and to have been able to produce this project as at today is very impressive. i planned to go further in my project though to the stretch features, and I noticed that a few of my peers did go further to create sort functions and much more.
